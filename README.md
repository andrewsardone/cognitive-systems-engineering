# Cognitive Systems Engineering

This page lists resesarch papers in the field of cognitive systems engineering. 

Many cogntive engineering researchers went on to do work in the field of
resilience engineering. See <http://resiliencepapers.club> for resilience
engineering papers.

Some papers have a ([TWRR](http://resilienceroundup.com)) link next to them. This
stands for Thai Wood's [Resilience Roundup](http://resilienceroundup.com). Thai publishes a newsletter that
summarizes resilience engineering papers.
